# Don't Save Created Levels
It makes it so the Cloud Save feature ignores all created levels.

<cr>Warning:</c> When you <cl>Save Without Levels</c>, the <co>Load</c> feature will be <c FF00FF>unable</c> to recover any of your levels. Make sure you keep a backup of your important levels elsewhere, for example in the form of unlisted levels.
